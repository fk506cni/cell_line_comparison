The slants were washed with 10ml of chilled, sterile, deionized water and spun at 10,000 x g for 10 minutes and resuspended in 10ml chilled water.  The spore suspension was heated at 65C degrees for 30 minutes to kill vegetative bacteria.  After heat treatment the spores were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 10,000 x g.  The supernatant and the very top layer of the pellet were aspirated and then the spores were resuspended in chilled sterile deionized water and centrifuged for 10 minutes.  The pellet was washed 5 times to remove contaminating cell debris.  The titer of the spore preparation was determined by plate counts.  The spores were diluted to 1 X 109 spores/ml and stored at 4C.

"c(\Human fetal mesenchymal stem cells were isolated from 3 sources (fetal blood, bone marrow and liver, from 9-14 week old fetuses), all from different individuals at legal abortion after informed consent from the patients. Procedures were approved by Hammersmith and Queen Charlotte’s Research Ethics Committee.\, \\, \Fetal liver was disintegrated by passage through a 100 μm nylon filter and fetal bone marrow was prepared by flushing long bones with 25-gauge needles. Single cells were suspended in DMEM-High Glucose supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mmol/l L-glutamine and 50 IU/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were plated at 1.8x104 cells/cm2 in 10 cm Petri dishes and maintained at 37oC in a humidified environment containing 5% CO2. After 3 days, the non-adherent cells were removed and the medium replaced. The medium was changed every three to four days thereafter. At sub-confluence (70%), cells were detached using 0.05% trypsin and 0.53 mM EDTA and replated at a density of 4x103 cells/cm2. Cells were counted and thereafter snap frozen in  80ºC.\

The concentration of 1 µM rhCXCL4 was chosen because this concentration was previously demonstrated to be sufficient to induce macrophage differentiation from monocytes (13).

Gruen) with the Bioretis database (http://www.bioretis-analysis.de/) using the default filter parameters for decreased and increased gene lists (description of database c.f. open access paper Menssen et al., 2009; PMID: 19265543). Chip data included in the Bioretis database were analyzed using the GeneChip Operating Software (GCOS, Affymetrix), version 1.4. Microarrays were globally normalized and scaled to a trimmed mean expression value of 150. Quality checks were performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. All three chips of one group were compared to any of the three chips of a second group (9 comparisons,between two groups) and all chips were additionally compared within each group,(6 comparisons within each group). The following parameters of absolute and comparative analysis were included in the Bioretis database: expression heights (Signals) and mean, median and standard deviation of Signals of both groups, call for presence of transcripts (Absent, A; Marginal, M; Present, P), p value for presence or absence of transcripts, log2 value of fold change (Signal Log Ratio, SLR) and the calculated fold change as mean values, call for the significance of differentially expression (Change Call: Increase, I; Marginal I, MI; Decrease, D; Marginal D, MD; No Change, NC), and the p value for that call. Additionally – not with GCOS calculated – t tests of log Signals and SLRs were included in the database. For each present transcript the significance of differential expression between the groups of arrays was either calculated using (a) strict Bonferroni corrected Welch t tests between 9 SLR values of group 1 vs group 2 and 6 plus 6 SLR values within both groups (the latter 12 giving a mean SLR value of zero; p-value had to be <= 5.279E-08) or (b) more than 50% of non parametrically calculated Change calls (Mann-Whitney U test, GCOS) i.e. 5 or more of all 9 Change calls have to be in the same direction. Significantly differentially expressed genes were filtered using the both default parameter sets (for up- and downregulated genes separately) of filter criteria; these are a combination of four different queries. Filter criteria were developed with various data sets of GeneChips and validated with the Affymetrix Latin Square dataset as shown in Menssen et al., 2009; PubMedID: 19265543."	54675	"c(\Gene expression profiles of FACSAria sorted (a) CD3- CD56bright CD62L+, (b) CD3- CD56dim CD62L+ and (c) CD3- CD56dim CD62L- NK cells from human peripheral blood of three donors were compared using Affymetrix GeneChip HG-U133_Plus_2 arrays.
